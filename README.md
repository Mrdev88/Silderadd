# Silderadd
A app where you move sliders around and then you can add, subtract, multiply, divide and find the exponent. (The reason why the name of the app is Silderadd instead of Slideradd is because i made a mistake but i'll leave it.)

Here's the link to the app on MIT App Inventor: https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=81807057-803c-4bc1-9dad-ccd7e63857c0
